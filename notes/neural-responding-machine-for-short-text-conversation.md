# [Neural Responding Machine for Short-Text Conversation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02364v2.pdf)

The athour proposes neural responding machine (NRM), 
a neural network based response generator for Short-Text Conversation. 
The basic idea of NRM is to build a hidden representation of a post, 
and then generate the response based on it. 

Questions 1: The Encoder-Decoder model may be a good fit for Statistical Machine Translation problem, 
but does it really work for conversation tasks? 

Question 2: Is the final hidden state a good representation of the full sentence? 
What other options do we have?
